    "# Firn modeling\n",
    "Ice-sheet mass-balance estimates derived from surface altimetry observations require careful consideration of spatial variations in firn density. Firn models remain a large source of uncertainty within continental mass-balance estimates because of simplifying assumptions for densification physics, which often neglect the effects of horizontal strain on the integrated firn-air-content (FAC). We aim to include the effects of horizontal divergence and convergence on the densification of snow and firn in continental/catchment scale simulations of ice sheet mass change by building an extensible firn model that ingests multi-demensional strain regime information. The variables that define the state of the firn are the density, the vertical velocity of the firn, and the energy density. The densification of snow to ice is often defined by the material derivative, which in 1D can be written as\n",

These can be broken up into energy density sources, and change as near surface heat conducts through the densifying firn.
